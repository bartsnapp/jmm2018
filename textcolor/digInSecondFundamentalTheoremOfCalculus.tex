Hello, I'm a closed interval $[0,4]$.

Arr--back? NOW???? NOW?? NOOOOWWW

Now to be ``continuous.'' We begin with a series of definitions. We are
very used to ``open intervals'' such as $(1,3)$, which represents the set
of all $x$ such that $1<x<3$, and ``closed intervals'' such as
$[1,3]$, which represents the set of all $x$ such that $1\leq x\leq
3$.
